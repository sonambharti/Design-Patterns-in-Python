# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The ISP states that a client should not be forced to depend on interfaces that it does not use.

## Introduction
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states:
```
"Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use."
```

In simpler terms: Rather than having one large interface, it's better to have multiple smaller, specific interfaces so that classes only need to implement methods they actually use.
